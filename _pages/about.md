"We must always change, renew, rejuvenate ourselves; otherwise, we harden." 
—— Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

Hi guys, welcome to my site!

Xujun is here, originally from Anhui province, eastern China. I pursued higher education, earning a bachelor's degree from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/)  and a doctoral degree from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn). Currently, I am conducting my postdoctoral research at [Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI)](https://www.psi.ch/en) in Switzerland. This academic journey has opened doors for me to visit fascinating places, meet extraordinary people, and engage in meaningful endeavours.

My current research primarily focuses on hydrogen production, catalytic hydrothermal reaction, and waste treatment. Just reach out to me if you'd like to discuss these topics further.

Feel free to contact me via WeChat: [WeChat](../assets/WeChat.pdf).
